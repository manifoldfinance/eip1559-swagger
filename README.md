## EIP1559 Simple Summary
A transaction pricing mechanism that includes fixed-per-block network
fee that is burned and dynamically expands/contracts block sizes to deal
with transient congestion.

## Abstract
We introduce a new [EIP-2718](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/EIPs/master/EIPS/eip-2718.md) transaction type, with the
format `0x02 || rlp([chainId, nonce, maxInclusionFeePerGas,
maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, access_list, signatureYParity,
signatureR, signatureS])`.

There is a base fee per gas in protocol, which can move up or down each
block according to a formula which is a function of gas used in parent
block and gas target (formerly known as gas limit) of parent block.
The algorithm results in the base fee per gas increasing when blocks are
above the gas target, and decreasing when blocks are below the gas
target.
The base fee per gas is burned.
Transactions specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to give to
miners to incentivize them to include their transaction (aka: inclusion
fee).
Transactions also specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to
pay total (aka: max fee), which covers both the inclusion fee and the
block's network fee per gas (aka: base fee).
The transaction will always pay the base fee per gas of the block it was
included in, and they will pay the inclusion fee per gas set in the
transaction, as long as the combined amount of the two fees doesn't
exceed the transaction's maximum fee per gas.
